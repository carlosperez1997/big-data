## [Spark with R](https://therinspark.com)

## Introduction

**Apache Spark as a leading tool that is democratizing our ability to process large datasets.** With this as a backdrop, we introduce the R computing language, which was specifically designed to simplify data analysis. Finally, this leads us to introduce **sparklyr, a project merging R and Spark into a powerful tool that is easily accessible to all.**

### **Hadoop**

Search engines like Google were unable to store all of the web page information required to support web searches in a single computer. This meant that they had to split information into several files and store them across many machines. This approach became known as the Google File System, and was presented in a research paper published in 2003 by Google.

One year later, Google published a new paper describing how to perform operations across the Google File System, an approach that came to be known as MapReduce.

There are two operations in MapReduce: map and reduce. The map operation provides an arbitrary way to transform each file into a new file, whereas the reduce operation combines two files. Both operations require custom computer code, but the **MapReduce framework takes care of automatically executing them across many computers at once.** These two operations are sufficient to process all the data available on the web, while also providing enough flexibility to extract meaningful information from it.

![](https://therinspark.com/the-r-in-spark_files/figure-html/intro-mapreduce-example-1.png)

Counting words is often the most basic MapReduce example, but we can also use MapReduce for much more sophisticated and interesting applications.

After these papers were released by Google, a team at Yahoo worked on implementing the Google File System and MapReduce as a single open source project. This project was released in 2006 as Hadoop, with the Google File System implemented as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). **The Hadoop project made distributed file-based computing accessible to a wider range of users and organizations, making MapReduce useful beyond web data processing.**

Although Hadoop provided support to perform MapReduce operations over a distributed file system, it still required MapReduce operations to be written with code every time a data analysis was run. To improve upon this tedious process, the Hive project, released in 2008 by Facebook, brought Structured Query Language (SQL) support to Hadoop. This meant that data analysis could now be performed at large scale without the need to write code for each MapReduce operation; instead, one could write generic data analysis statements in SQL, which are much easier to understand and write.

### **Spark**

In 2009, Apache Spark began as a research project at UC Berkeley’s AMPLab to improve on MapReduce. Specifically, Spark provided a richer set of verbs beyond MapReduce to facilitate optimizing code running in multiple machines. Spark also loaded data in-memory, making operations much faster than Hadoop’s on-disk storage.

Spark is also easier to use than Hadoop; for instance, the word-counting MapReduce example takes about 50 lines of code in Hadoop, but it takes only 2 lines of code in Spark. As you can see, Spark is much faster, more efficient, and easier to use than Hadoop.

**Describing Spark as large scale implies that a good use case for Spark is tackling problems that can be solved with multiple machines. For instance, when data does not fit on a single disk drive or into memory, Spark is a good candidate to consider.**

Therefore, Spark is good at tackling large-scale data-processing problems, usually known as big data (datasets that are more voluminous and complex than traditional ones) **but it is also good at tackling large-scale computation problems, known as big compute** (tools and approaches using a large amount of CPU and memory resources in a coordinated way).

### **Big Data**

**When working in Data Science or Machine Learning, you will be faced with increasingly large datasets or increasingly complex computations that are slow to execute or at times even impossible to process in a single computer**. However, it is important to understand that Spark does not need to be the answer to all our computations problems; instead, when faced with computing challenges in R, using the following techniques can be as effective:

- **Sampling**
A first approach to try is to reduce the amount of data being handled, through sampling. However, we must sample the data properly by applying sound statistical principles. For instance, selecting the top results is not sufficient in sorted datasets; with simple random sampling, there might be underrepresented groups, which we could overcome with stratified sampling, which in turn adds complexity to properly select categories. 

- **Profiling**
You can try to understand why a computation is slow and make the necessary improvements. A profiler is a tool capable of inspecting code execution to help identify bottlenecks. It’s not always trivial to optimize.

- **Scaling Up**
**Speeding up computation is usually possible by buying faster or more capable hardware (say, increasing your machine memory, upgrading your hard drive, or procuring a machine with many more CPUs); this approach is known as scaling up.** However, there are usually hard limits as to how much a single computer can scale up, and even with significant CPUs, you need to find frameworks that parallelize computation efficiently.

- **Scaling Out**
Finally, we can consider **spreading computation and storage across multiple machines. This approach provides the highest degree of scalability because you can potentially use an arbitrary number of machines to perform a computation.** This approach is commonly known as scaling out. However, spreading computation effectively across many machines is a complex endeavor, especially without using specialized tools and frameworks like Apache Spark.

### [sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com/dplyr/)

**sparklyr is an R interface for Apache Spark.** It’s available in CRAN and works like any other CRAN package.

Spark as a modern and powerful computing platform, R as an easy-to-use computing language with solid foundations in statistical methods, and sparklyr as a project bridging both technologies and communities. In a world in which the total amount of information is growing exponentially, learning how to analyze data at scale will help you to tackle the problems and opportunities humanity is facing today.

From R, getting started with Spark using sparklyr and a local cluster is as easy as installing and loading the sparklyr package followed by installing Spark using sparklyr. For instance, Databricks hosts a free community edition of Spark that you can easily access from your web browser.

After you are done with the prerequisites, you will first learn how to connect to Spark. We then present the most important tools and operations that you’ll use throughout the rest of this book.

All Spark operations are run from R; however, monitoring execution of distributed operations is performed from Spark’s web interface, which you can load from any web browser. We then disconnect from this local cluster, which is easy to forget to do but highly recommended while working with local clusters—and in shared Spark clusters as well!

Because Spark is built in the Scala programming language, which is run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you also need to install Java 8 on your system.


```{r intro}
#install.packages("sparklyr")
#packageVersion("sparklyr")

library(sparklyr)
spark_install("2.3")
```

So far, **we’ve installed only a local Spark cluster. A local cluster is really helpful to get started, test code, and troubleshoot with ease.** Later chapters explain where to find, install, and connect to real Spark clusters with many machines, but for the first few chapters, we focus on using local clusters.

```{r connecting}
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")
```

**The master parameter identifies which is the “main” machine from the Spark cluster; this machine is often called the driver node. While working with real clusters using many machines, you’ll find that most machines will be worker machines and one will be the master.** Since we have only a local cluster with just one machine, we will default to using "local" for now.

After a connection is established, spark_connect() retrieves an active Spark connection, which most code usually names sc; you will then make use of sc to execute Spark commands.

```{r using}
cars <- copy_to(sc, mtcars)
cars
```
## Spark web interface

**Most of the Spark commands are executed from the R console; however, monitoring and analyzing execution is done through Spark’s web interface.**

```{r spark_jobs}
spark_web(sc)
```

![](https://therinspark.com/images/starting-spark-web-resized.png)

Printing the cars dataset collected a few records to be displayed in the R console. You can see in the Spark web interface that a job was started to collect this information back from Spark.

![](https://therinspark.com/images/starting-spark-web-storage.png)
The Executors tab provides a view of your cluster resources. For local connections, you will find only one executor active with only 2 GB of memory allocated to Spark, and 384 MB available for computation.

![](https://therinspark.com/images/starting-spark-web-executors-resized.png)

## Analysis

When using Spark from R to analyze data, you can use SQL (Structured Query Language) or dplyr (a grammar of data manipulation). You can use SQL through the DBI package; for instance, to count how many records are available in our cars dataset, we can run the following:

```{r analysis}
library(DBI)
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT count(*) FROM mtcars")
```
When using dplyr, you write less code, and it’s often much easier to write than SQL.

```{r analysis2}
library(dplyr)
print(count(cars))

select(cars, hp, mpg) %>%
  sample_n(100) %>%
  collect() %>%
  plot()
```

## Modelling

We can use a linear model to approximate the relationship between fuel efficiency and horsepower:

```{r model_stat}
model <- ml_linear_regression(cars, mpg ~ hp)
model
```

```{r model_pred}
model %>%
  ml_predict(copy_to(sc, data.frame(hp = 250 + 10 * 1:10))) %>%
  transmute(hp = hp, mpg = prediction) %>%
  full_join(select(cars, hp, mpg)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  plot()
```


## Data

For simplicity, we copied the mtcars dataset into Spark; however, **data is usually not copied into Spark. Instead, data is read from existing data sources in a variety of formats, like plain text, CSV, JSON, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).**

```{r data}
#spark_write_csv(cars, "cars.csv")
cars <- spark_read_csv(sc, "cars.csv")
```

## Extensions

The sparkly.nested extension is an R package that extends sparklyr to help you manage values that contain nested information. A common use case involves JSON files that contain nested lists that require preprocessing before you can do meaningful data analysis.

```{r extensions}
sparklyr.nested::sdf_nest(cars, hp) %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(data = collect_list(data))
```


## Distributed R

**For those few cases when a particular functionality is not available in Spark and no extension has been developed, you can consider distributing your own R code across the Spark cluster.** This is a powerful tool, but it comes with additional complexity, so you should only use it as a last resort.

Suppose that we need to round all of the values across all the columns in our dataset. One approach would be running custom R code, making use of R’s round() function:

```{r extensions2}
cars %>% spark_apply(~round(.x))
```

**If you are a proficient R user, it can be quite tempting to use spark_apply() for everything, but please, don’t! spark_apply() was designed for advanced use cases where Spark falls short.**

### Logs

Logging is definitely less interesting than real-time data processing; however, it’s a tool you should be or become familiar with. A log is just a text file to which Spark appends information relevant to the execution of tasks in the cluster. For local clusters, we can retrieve all the recent logs by running the following:


```{r logs1}
spark_log(sc)
```


```{r logs2}
spark_log(sc, filter = "sparklyr")
```


### Disconnecting

For local clusters (really, any cluster), after you are done processing data, you should disconnect by running the following:

```{r disconnect1}
spark_disconnect(sc)
```

This terminates the connection to the cluster as well as the cluster tasks. If multiple Spark connections are active, or if the connection instance sc is no longer available, you can also disconnect all your Spark connections by running this command:

```{r disconnect2}
spark_disconnect_all()
```

## Analysis

In a data analysis project, the main goal is to understand what the data is trying to “tell us”, hoping that it provides an answer to a specific question.

![](https://therinspark.com/the-r-in-spark_files/figure-html/analysis-steps-1.png)

As the diagram illustrates, we first import data into our analysis stem, where we wrangle it by trying different data transformations, such as aggregations. We then visualize the data to help us perceive relationships and trends. To gain deeper insight, we can fit one or multiple statistical models against sample data. This will help us find out whether the patterns hold true when new data is applied to them. Lastly, the results are communicated publicly or privately to colleagues and stakeholders.

When working with not-large-scale datasets—as in datasets that fit in memory—we can perform all those steps from R, without using Spark. However, when data does not fit in memory or computation is simply too slow, we can slightly modify this approach by incorporating Spark. But how?

For data analysis, **the ideal approach is to let Spark do what it’s good at. Spark is a(((“parallel execution”))) parallel computation engine that works at a large scale and provides a SQL engine and modeling libraries.**

For example, when you need to fit a linear regression model, instead of using R’s familiar lm() function, you would use Spark’s ml_linear_regression() function. This R function then calls Spark to create this model. 

**For more common data manipulation tasks, sparklyr provides a backend for dplyr. This means you can use dplyr verbs with which you’re already familiar in R, and then sparklyr and dplyr will translate those actions into Spark SQL statements, which are generally more compact and easier to read than SQL statements.**


```{r connect1}
library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")
```


## Import

When using Spark with R, you need to approach importing data differently. Usually, importing means that R will read files and load them into memory; when you are using Spark, the data is imported into Spark, not R.

Note: When you’re performing analysis over large-scale datasets, the vast majority of the necessary data will already be available in your Spark cluster (which is usually made available to users via Hive tables or by accessing the file system directly).

**Rather than importing all data into Spark, you can request Spark to access the data source without importing it** — this is a decision you should make based on speed and performance. **Importing all of the data into the Spark session incurs a one-time up-front cost, since Spark needs to wait for the data to be loaded before analyzing it.** If the data is not imported, you usually incur a cost with every Spark operation since Spark needs to retrieve a subset from the cluster’s storage, which is usually disk drives that happen to be much slower than reading from Spark’s memory.


```{r import1}
cars <- copy_to(sc, mtcars)
```

Note: **When using real clusters, you should use copy_to() to transfer only small tables from R; large data transfers should be performed with specialized data transfer tools.**

## Wrangle

Data wrangling uses transformations to understand the data. It is often referred to as the process of transforming data from one “raw” data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate for data analysis.

Malformed or missing values and columns with multiple attributes are common data problems you might need to fix, since they prevent you from understanding your dataset. For example, a “name” field contains the last and first name of a customer. There are two attributes (first and last name) in a single column. To be usable, we need to transform the “name” field, by changing it into “first_name” and “last_name” fields.

The main goal is to write the data transformations using R syntax as much as possible.


```{r wrangle1}
summarize_all(cars, mean)
```

While this code is exactly the same as the code you would run when using dplyr without Spark, a lot is happening under the hood. The data is not being imported into R; instead, dplyr converts this task into SQL statements that are then sent to Spark. **The show_query() command makes it possible to peer into the SQL statement that sparklyr and dplyr created and sent to Spark.**

```{r wrangle2}
summarize_all(cars, mean) %>%
  show_query()
```


```{r wrangle3}
cars %>%
  mutate(transmission = ifelse(am == 0, "automatic", "manual")) %>%
  group_by(transmission) %>%
  summarise_all(mean)
```

### Built-in functions

**Spark SQL is based on Hive’s SQL conventions and functions, and it is possible to call all these functions using dplyr as well. This means that we can use any Spark SQL functions to accomplish operations that might not be available via dplyr.** We can access the functions by calling them as if they were R functions.

```{r wrangle4}
summarise(cars, mpg_percentile = percentile(mpg, 0.25))
```

There is no percentile() function in R, so dplyr passes that portion of the code as-is to the resulting SQL query:

```{r wrangle5}
summarise(cars, mpg_percentile = percentile(mpg, 0.25)) %>%
  show_query()
```

To pass multiple values to percentile(), we can call another Hive function called array(). In this case, array() would work similarly to R’s list() function.

```{r wrangle6}
summarise(cars, mpg_percentile = percentile(mpg, array(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)))
```

**You can use the explode() function to separate Spark’s array value results into their own record.** To do this, use explode() within a mutate() command, and pass the variable containing the results of the percentile operation:


```{r wrangle7}
summarise(cars, mpg_percentile = percentile(mpg, array(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))) %>%
  mutate(mpg_percentile = explode(mpg_percentile))
```

We have included a comprehensive list of all the Hive functions in the section [Hive Functions](https://therinspark.com/appendix.html#hive-functions). Glance over them to get a sense of the wide range of operations that you can accomplish with them.




### Correlations

A very common exploration technique is to calculate and visualize correlations.


```{r corr1}
ml_corr(cars)
```


We can pipe the results to other corrr functions. For example, the shave() function turns all of the duplicated results into NAs.

```{r corr2}
library(corrr)
correlate(cars, use = "pairwise.complete.obs", method = "pearson") %>%
  shave() %>%
  rplot()
```

It is much easier to see which relationships are positive or negative: positive relationships are in gray, and negative relationships are black. The size of the circle indicates how significant their relationship is. The power of visualizing data is in how much easier it makes it for us to understand results.

### Visualize

Visualizations are a vital tool to help us find patterns in the data. It is easier for us to identify outliers in a dataset of 1,000 observations when plotted in a graph, as opposed to reading them from a list.


```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(aes(as.factor(cyl), mpg), data = mtcars) + geom_col()

```

In Spark, there are a couple of key steps when codifying the **“push compute, collect results” approach.** **First, ensure that the transformation operations happen within Spark. In the example that follows, group_by() and summarise() will run inside Spark. The second is to bring the results back into R after the data has been transformed. Be sure to transform and then collect, in that order; if collect() is run first, R will try to ingest the entire dataset from Spark. Depending on the size of the data, collecting all of the data will slow down or can even bring down your system.**

```{r collect}
car_group <- cars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mpg = sum(mpg, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  print()
```

The approach, then, is to **push as much compute to the cluster as possible**, using R primarily as an interface to Spark for the Data Scientist, which will then **collect as few results as possible** back into R memory, mostly to visualize and communicate. As shown in the slide, the more import, tidy, transform and modeling work we can push to Spark, the faster we can analyze very large data sets.

![](https://spark.rstudio.com/guides/data-lakes/images/deployment/data-lakes/slide-3.png)



#### Using [dbplot](https://edgararuiz.github.io/dbplot/)

**The dbplot package provides helper functions for plotting with remote data. The R code dbplot that’s used to transform the data is written so that it can be translated into Spark.** 

The dbplot_histogram() function makes Spark calculate the bins and the count per bin and outputs a ggplot object, which we can further refine by adding more steps to the plot object. dbplot_histogram() also accepts a binwidth argument to control the range used to compute the bins:

```{r plot2}
library(dbplot)

cars %>%
dbplot_histogram(mpg, binwidth = 3) +
labs(title = "MPG Distribution",
     subtitle = "Histogram over miles per gallon")

```
A raster plot returns a grid of x/y positions and the results of a given aggregation, usually represented by the color of the square.

Raster: To visualize two continuous variables, we typically resort to a Scatter plot. However, this may not be practical when visualizing millions or billions of dots representing the intersections of the two variables. A Raster plot may be a better option, because it concentrates the intersections into squares that are easier to parse visually.

A Raster plot basically does the same as a Histogram. It takes two continuous variables and creates discrete 2-dimensional bins represented as squares in the plot. It then determines either the number of rows inside each square or processes some aggregation, like an average.

You can use dbplot_raster() to create a scatter-like plot in Spark, while only retrieving (collecting) a small subset of the remote dataset:

```{r plot3}
dbplot_raster(cars, mpg, wt, resolution = 16)
```

## Model

We want to cover how to interact with models while doing data analysis.

```{r modelling1}
cars %>% 
  ml_linear_regression(mpg ~ .) %>%
  summary()
```

At this point, it is very easy to experiment with different features, we can simply change the R formula from mpg ~ . to, say, mpg ~ hp + cyl to only use horsepower and cylinders as features:

```{r modelling2}
cars %>% 
  ml_linear_regression(mpg ~ hp + cyl) %>%
  summary()
```

It is also very easy to iterate with other kinds of models. The following one replaces the linear model with a generalized linear model:

```{r modelling3}
cars %>% 
  ml_generalized_linear_regression(mpg ~ hp + cyl) %>%
  summary()
```

### Cache

The examples in this chapter are built using a very small dataset. **In real-life scenarios, large amounts of data are used for models. If the data needs to be transformed first, the volume of the data could exact a heavy toll on the Spark session. Before fitting the models, it is a good idea to save the results of all the transformations in a new table loaded in Spark memory.**

The **compute() command** can take the end of a dplyr command and save the results to Spark memory:

```{r cache1}
cached_cars <- cars %>% 
  mutate(cyl = paste0("cyl_", cyl)) %>%
  compute("cached_cars")
```

```{r cache2}
cached_cars %>%
  ml_linear_regression(mpg ~ .) %>%
  summary()
```

# Modelling

We explore MLlib, the component of Spark that allows you to write high-level code to perform predictive modeling on distributed data, and use data wrangling in the context of feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.

The R interface to Spark provides modeling algorithms that should be familiar to R users, and we’ll go into detail in the chapter. For instance, we’ve already used ml_linear_regression(cars, mpg ~ .), but we could run ml_logistic_regression(cars, am ~ .) just as easily.

The long list of MLlib functions included in the appendix of this book; Spark supports Decision Trees, Gradient-Boosted Trees, Accelerated Failure Time Survival Regression, Isotonic Regression, K-Means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Clustering, and more.

The ML interface in sparklyr has been designed to minimize the cognitive effort for moving from a local, in-memory, native-R workflow to the cluster, and back. 

You can download this dataset as follows:

```{r download1}
download.file(
  "https://github.com/r-spark/okcupid/raw/master/profiles.csv.zip",
  "okcupid.zip")

unzip("okcupid.zip", exdir = "data")
unlink("okcupid.zip")
```


We don’t recommend sampling this dataset since the model won’t be nearly as rich; however, if you have limited hardware resources, you are welcome to sample it as follows:

```{r download2}
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv")
#write.csv(dplyr::sample_n(profiles, 10^3),
#          "data/profiles.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The examples in this chapter utilize small datasets so that you can easily follow along in local mode. In practice, if your dataset fits comfortably in memory on your local machine, you might be better off using an efficient, nondistributed implementation of the modeling algorithm. For example, you might want to use the ranger package instead of ml_random_forest_classifier().

## **EDA**

Exploratory data analysis (EDA), in the context of predictive modeling, is the exercise of looking at excerpts and summaries of the data. Some common objectives:

- Check for data quality; confirm meaning and prevalence of missing values and reconcile statistics against existing controls.
- Understand univariate relationships between variables.
- Perform an initial assessment on what variables to include and what transformations need to be done on them.

```{r eda}
library(sparklyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dbplot)
library(dplyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")

okc <- spark_read_csv(
  sc, 
  "data/profiles.csv", 
  escape = "\"", 
  memory = FALSE,
  options = list(multiline = TRUE)
) %>%
  mutate(
    height = as.numeric(height),
    income = ifelse(income == "-1", NA, as.numeric(income))
  ) %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(is.na(sex), "missing", sex)) %>%
  mutate(drinks = ifelse(is.na(drinks), "missing", drinks)) %>%
  mutate(drugs = ifelse(is.na(drugs), "missing", drugs)) %>%
  mutate(job = ifelse(is.na(job), "missing", job))
```

We also convert the height and income columns to numeric types and recode missing values in the string columns. Note that it might very well take a few tries of specifying different parameters to get the initial data ingest correct, and sometimes you might need to revisit this step after you learn more about the data during modeling.

```{r okc}
glimpse(okc)
```


```{r okc2}
okc <- okc %>%
  mutate(
    not_working = ifelse(job %in% c("student", "unemployed", "retired"), 1 , 0)
  )

okc %>% 
  group_by(not_working) %>% 
  tally()
```

Before we proceed further, let’s perform an initial split of our data into a training set and a testing set and put away the latter. In practice, this is a crucial step because we would like to have a holdout set that we set aside at the end of the modeling process to evaluate model performance. If we were to include the entire dataset during EDA, information from the testing set could “leak” into the visualizations and summary statistics and bias our model-building process even though the data is not used directly in a learning algorithm.

```{r okc3}
data_splits <- sdf_random_split(okc, training = 0.8, testing = 0.2, seed = 42)
okc_train <- data_splits$training
okc_test <- data_splits$testing
```

We can quickly look at the distribution of our response variable:

```{r okc4}
okc_train %>%
  group_by(not_working) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(frac = n / sum(n))
```

Using the sdf_describe() function, we can obtain numerical summaries of specific columns:

```{r okc5}
sdf_describe(okc_train, cols = c("age", "income"))
```

We can also utilize the dbplot package to plot distributions of these variables.

```{r okc6}
dbplot_histogram(okc_train, age)
```

A common EDA exercise is to look at the relationships between the response and the individual predictors. Often, you might have prior business knowledge of what these relationships should be, so this can serve as a data quality check.

```{r okc7}
prop_data <- okc_train %>%
  mutate(religion = regexp_extract(religion, "^\\\\w+", 0)) %>% 
  group_by(religion, not_working) %>%
  tally() %>%
  group_by(religion) %>%
  summarize(
    count = sum(n),
    prop = sum(not_working * n) / sum(n)
  ) %>%
  mutate(se = sqrt(prop * (1 - prop) / count)) %>%
  collect()

prop_data
```

Note that prop_data is a small DataFrame that has been collected into memory in our R session, we can take advantage of ggplot2 to create an informative visualization:

```{r okc8}
prop_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = religion, y = prop)) + geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = prop - 1.96 * se, ymax = prop + 1.96 * se),
                width = .1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = sum(prop_data$prop * prop_data$count) /
                              sum(prop_data$count))
```

We take a look at the relationship between a couple of predictors: alcohol use and drug use. We would expect there to be some correlation between them. You can compute a contingency table via sdf_crosstab():

```{r okc9}
contingency_tbl <- okc_train %>% 
  sdf_crosstab("drinks", "drugs") %>%
  collect()

contingency_tbl
```

We can visualize this contingency table using a mosaic plot:

```{r okc10}
library(ggmosaic)
library(forcats)
library(tidyr)

contingency_tbl %>%
  rename(drinks = drinks_drugs) %>%
  gather("drugs", "count", missing:sometimes) %>%
  mutate(
    drinks = as_factor(drinks) %>% 
      fct_relevel("missing", "not at all", "rarely", "socially", 
                  "very often", "desperately"),
    drugs = as_factor(drugs) %>%
      fct_relevel("missing", "never", "sometimes", "often")
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(drinks, drugs), fill = drinks, 
                  weight = count))
```


To further explore the relationship between these two variables, we can perform correspondence analysis18 using the FactoMineR package. This technique enables us to summarize the relationship between the high-dimensional factor levels by mapping each level to a point on the plane. 


```{r okc11}
dd_obj <- contingency_tbl %>% 
  tibble::column_to_rownames(var = "drinks_drugs") %>%
  FactoMineR::CA(graph = FALSE)
```

We can then plot the results using ggplot.

```{r okc12}
dd_drugs <-
  dd_obj$row$coord %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(
    label = gsub("_", " ", rownames(dd_obj$row$coord)),
    Variable = "Drugs"
  )

dd_drinks <-
  dd_obj$col$coord %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(
    label = gsub("_", " ", rownames(dd_obj$col$coord)),
    Variable = "Alcohol"
  )
  
ca_coord <- rbind(dd_drugs, dd_drinks)
  
ggplot(ca_coord, aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`, 
                     col = Variable)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label)) +
  coord_equal()
```

We see that the correspondence analysis procedure has transformed the factors into variables called principal coordinates, which correspond to the axes in the plot and represent how much information in the contingency table they contain. We can, for example, interpret the proximity of “drinking often” and “using drugs very often” as indicating association.

## Feature Engineering

The feature engineering exercise comprises transforming the data to increase the performance of the model. This can include things like centering and scaling numerical values and performing string manipulation to extract meaningful variables.

```{r fea1}
scale_values <- okc_train %>%
  summarize(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm=T),
    sd_age = sd(age, na.rm=T)
  ) %>%
  collect()

scale_values
```

We can then use these to transform the dataset:

```{r fea2}
okc_train <- okc_train %>%
  mutate(scaled_age = (age - !!scale_values$mean_age) /
           !!scale_values$sd_age)
```


Since some of the profile features are multiple-select—in other words, a person can choose to associate multiple options for a variable—we need to process them before we can build meaningful models.

```{r fea3}
okc_train %>%
  group_by(ethnicity) %>%
  tally()
```

One way to proceed would be to treat each combination of races as a separate level, but that would lead to a very large number of levels, which becomes problematic in many algorithms. To better encode this information, we can create dummy variables for each race, as follows:

```{r fea4}
ethnicities <- c("asian", "middle eastern", "black", "native american", "indian", 
                 "pacific islander", "hispanic / latin", "white", "other")
ethnicity_vars <- ethnicities %>% 
  purrr::map(~ expr(ifelse(like(ethnicity, !!.x), 1, 0))) %>%
  purrr::set_names(paste0("ethnicity_", gsub("\\s|/", "", ethnicities)))
okc_train <- mutate(okc_train, !!!ethnicity_vars)
okc_train %>% 
  select(starts_with("ethnicity_")) %>%
  glimpse()
```

For the free text fields, a straightforward way to extract features is counting the total number of characters. We will store the train dataset in Spark’s memory with compute() to speed up computation.

```{r fea5}
okc_train <- okc_train %>%
  mutate(
    essay_length = char_length(paste(!!!syms(paste0("essay", 0:9))))
  ) %>% compute()
```

So let’s save it first as a Parquet file—an efficient file format ideal for numeric data:

```{r fea6}
#spark_write_parquet(okc_train, "data/okc-train.parquet")
```

# Supervised Learning

We need to come up with a plan to tune and validate the “candidate” models—in modeling projects, we often try different types of models and ways to fit them to see which ones perform the best. Since we are dealing with a binary classification problem, the metrics we can use include accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC).

It is important that we don’t peek at the testing holdout set until the very end, because any information we obtain could influence our modeling decisions, which would in turn make our estimates of model performance less credible.

Using the sdf_random_split() function, we can create a list of subsets from our okc_train table:

```{r super1}
vfolds <- sdf_random_split(
  okc_train,
  weights = purrr::set_names(rep(0.1, 10), paste0("fold", 1:10)),
  seed = 42
)
```

We then create our first analysis/assessment split as follows:

```{r super2}
analysis_set <- do.call(rbind, vfolds[2:10])
assessment_set <- vfolds[[1]]
```

One item we need to carefully treat here is the scaling of variables. We need to make sure that we do not leak any information from the assessment set to the analysis set, so we calculate the mean and standard deviation on the analysis set only and apply the same transformation to both sets. Here is how we would handle this for the age variable:

```{r super3}
make_scale_age <- function(analysis_data) {
  scale_values <- analysis_data %>%
    summarize(
      mean_age = mean(age, na.rm=T),
      sd_age = sd(age, na.rm=T)
    ) %>%
    collect()

  function(data) {
    data %>%
      mutate(scaled_age = (age - !!scale_values$mean_age) / !!scale_values$sd_age)
  }
}

scale_age <- make_scale_age(analysis_set)
train_set <- scale_age(analysis_set)
validation_set <- scale_age(assessment_set)
```

Logistic regression is often a reasonable starting point for binary classification problems, so let’s give it a try.

```{r super4}
lr <- ml_logistic_regression(
  analysis_set, not_working ~ scaled_age + sex + drinks + drugs + essay_length
)
lr
```

To obtain a summary of performance metrics on the assessment set, we can use the ml_evaluate() function:

```{r super5}
validation_summary <- ml_evaluate(lr, assessment_set)
validation_summary
```

We can plot the ROC curve by collecting the output of validation_summary$roc() and using ggplot2:

```{r super6}
roc <- validation_summary$roc() %>%
  collect()

ggplot(roc, aes(x = FPR, y = TPR)) +
  geom_line() + geom_abline(lty = "dashed")
```

The AUC is a summary measure for determining the quality of a model, and we can compute it by calling the area_under_roc() function.

```{r super7}
validation_summary$area_under_roc()
```

Spark provides evaluation methods for only generalized linear models (including linear models and logistic regression). For other algorithms, you can use the evaluator functions (e.g., ml_binary_classification_evaluator() on the prediction DataFrame) or compute your own metrics.

```{r super8}
cv_results <- purrr::map_df(1:10, function(v) {
  analysis_set <- do.call(rbind, vfolds[setdiff(1:10, v)]) %>% compute()
  assessment_set <- vfolds[[v]]
  
  scale_age <- make_scale_age(analysis_set)
  train_set <- scale_age(analysis_set)
  validation_set <- scale_age(assessment_set)
  
  model <- ml_logistic_regression(
    analysis_set, not_working ~ scaled_age + sex + drinks + drugs + essay_length
  )
  s <- ml_evaluate(model, assessment_set)
  roc_df <- s$roc() %>% 
    collect()
  auc <- s$area_under_roc()
  
  tibble(
    Resample = paste0("Fold", stringr::str_pad(v, width = 2, pad = "0")),
    roc_df = list(roc_df),
    auc = auc
  )
})
```

This gives us 10 ROC curves:

```{r super9}
unnest(cv_results, roc_df) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = FPR, y = TPR, color = Resample)) +
  geom_line() + geom_abline(lty = "dashed")
```


```{r super10}
mean(cv_results$auc)
```

### Generalized Linear Regression
If you are interested in generalized linear model (GLM) diagnostics,you can also fit a logistic regression via the generalized linear regression interface by specifying family = "binomial". Because the result is a regression model, the ml_predict() method does not give class probabilities. However, it includes confidence intervals for coefficient estimates:

```{r lin1}
glr <- ml_generalized_linear_regression(
  analysis_set, 
  not_working ~ scaled_age + sex + drinks + drugs, 
  family = "binomial"
)

tidy_glr <- tidy(glr)
```

We can extract the coefficient estimates into a tidy DataFrame, which we can then process further—for example, to create a coefficient plot, which you can see in Figure 4.9.

```{r lin2}
tidy_glr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = estimate - 1.96 * std.error, 
       ymax = estimate + 1.96 * std.error, width = .1)
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed")
```


Note: Both ml_logistic_regression() and ml_linear_regression() support elastic net regularization through the reg_param and elastic_net_param parameters. reg_param corresponds to \lambda, whereas elastic_net_param corresponds to \alpha. ml_generalized_linear_regression() supports only reg_param.

### Other Models
Spark supports many of the standard modeling algorithms and it’s easy to apply these models and hyperparameters (values that control the model-fitting process) for your particular problem. You can find a list of supported ML-related functions in the appendix. The interfaces to access these functionalities are largely identical, so it is easy to experiment with them. For example, to fit a neural network model we can run the following:

```{r lin3}
nn <- ml_multilayer_perceptron_classifier(
  analysis_set,
  not_working ~ scaled_age + sex + drinks + drugs + essay_length, 
  layers = c(12, 64, 64, 2)
)
```

This gives us a feedforward neural network model with two hidden layers of 64 nodes each. Note that you have to specify the correct values for the input and output layers in the layers argument. We can obtain predictions on a validation set using ml_predict():

```{r lin4}
predictions <- ml_predict(nn, assessment_set)
```

Then, we can compute the AUC via ml_binary_classification_evaluator():

```{r lin5}
ml_binary_classification_evaluator(predictions)
``` 

## Unsupervised learning

We show some basic text analysis capabilities of sparklyr. If you would like more background on text-mining techniques.

In this section, we show how to perform a basic topic-modeling task on the essay data in the OKCupid dataset. Our plan is to concatenate the essay fields (of which there are 10) of each profile and regard each profile as a document, then attempt to discover topics (we define these soon) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

### Data preparation

Before analyzing a dataset (or a subset of one), we want to take a quick look at it to orient ourselves.

```{r unsup1}
essay_cols <- paste0("essay", 0:9)
essays <- okc %>%
  select(!!essay_cols)
essays %>% 
  glimpse()
``` 

The HTML tags and special characters pollute the data since they are not directly input by the user and do not provide interesting information. Similarly, since we have encoded missing character fields with the missing string, we need to remove it.

Just from this output, we see the following:

- The text contains HTML tags
- The text contains the newline (\n) character
- There are missing values in the data

```{r unsup2}
essays <- essays %>%
  # Replace `missing` with empty string.
  mutate_all(list(~ ifelse(. == "missing", "", .))) %>%
  # Concatenate the columns.
  mutate(essay = paste(!!!syms(essay_cols))) %>%
  # Remove miscellaneous characters and HTML tags
  mutate(words = regexp_replace(essay, "\\n|&nbsp;|<[^>]*>|[^A-Za-z|']", " "))
``` 

Note here we are using regex_replace(), which is a Spark SQL function. 

### Topic Modeling
LDA is a type of topic model for identifying abstract “topics” in a set of documents. It is an unsupervised algorithm in that we do not provide any labels, or topics, for the input documents. LDA posits that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words. During training, it attempts to estimate both of these simultaneously. A typical use case for topic models involves categorizing many documents, for which the large number of documents renders manual approaches infeasible. The application domains range from GitHub issues to legal documents.

After we have a reasonably clean dataset following the workflow in the previous section, we can fit an LDA model with ml_lda():

```{r unsup3}
stop_words <- ml_default_stop_words(sc) %>%
  c(
    "like", "love", "good", "music", "friends", "people", "life",
    "time", "things", "food", "really", "also", "movies"
  )

lda_model <-  ml_lda(essays, ~ words, k = 6, max_iter = 1, min_token_length = 4, 
                     stop_words = stop_words, min_df = 5)
```

We are also including a stop_words vector, consisting of commonly used English words and common words in our dataset, that instructs the algorithm to ignore them. After the model is fit, we can use the tidy() function to extract the associated betas, which are the per-topic-per-word probabilities, from the model.

```{r unsup4}
betas <- tidy(lda_model)
betas
``` 

We can then visualize this output by looking at word probabilities by topic. In Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11, we show the results at 1 iteration and 100 iterations. The code that generates Figure 4.10 follows; to generate Figure 4.11, you would need to set max_iter = 100 when running ml_lda(), but beware that this can take a really long time in a single machine—this is the kind of big-compute problem that a proper Spark cluster would be able to easily tackle.

```{r unsup5}
betas %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta) %>%
  mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
    coord_flip()

file.remove("data/profiles.csv")
spark_disconnect(sc)
``` 

At 100 iterations, we can see “topics” starting to emerge. This could be interesting information in its own right if you were digging into a large collection of documents with which you aren’t familiar.

# Pipelines

The building blocks of pipelines are objects called **transformers** and **estimators**, which are collectively referred to as pipeline stages. **A transformer can be used to apply transformations to a DataFrame and return another DataFrame**; the resulting DataFrame often comprises the original DataFrame with new columns appended to it. An estimator, on the other hand, can be used to create a transformer giving some training data. Consider the following example to illustrate this relationship: a “center and scale” estimator can learn the mean and standard deviation of some data and store the statistics in a resulting transformer object; this transformer can then be used to normalize the data that it was trained on and also any new, yet unseen, data.

Here is an example of how to define an estimator:

```{r pipe1}
library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")

scaler <- ft_standard_scaler(
  sc,
  input_col = "features",
  output_col = "features_scaled",
  with_mean = TRUE)

scaler
``` 


We can now create some data (for which we know the mean and standard deviation) and then fit our scaling model to it using the ml_fit() function:

```{r pipe2}
df <- copy_to(sc, data.frame(value = rnorm(100000))) %>% 
  ft_vector_assembler(input_cols = "value", output_col = "features")

scaler_model <- ml_fit(scaler, df)
scaler_model
```

Note: In Spark ML, many algorithms and feature transformers require that the input be a vector column. **The function ft_vector_assembler() performs this task.** You can also use the function to initialize a transformer to be used in a pipeline.

We see that the mean and standard deviation are very close to 0 and 1, respectively, which is what we expect. We then can use the transformer to transform a DataFrame, using the ml_transform() function:

```{r pipe3}
scaler_model %>% 
  ml_transform(df) %>%
  glimpse()
```


### Creation

A pipeline is simply a sequence of transformers and estimators, and a pipeline model is a pipeline that has been trained on data so all of its components have been converted to transformers. There are a couple of ways to construct a pipeline in sparklyr, both of which use the **ml_pipeline() function**.

We can initialize an empty pipeline with ml_pipeline(sc) and append stages to it:

```{r pipe4}
ml_pipeline(sc) %>% 
  ft_standard_scaler(
    input_col = "features",
    output_col = "features_scaled", 
    with_mean = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, we can pass stages directly to ml_pipeline():

```{r pipe4_}
pipeline <- ml_pipeline(scaler)
```

We fit a pipeline as we would fit an estimator:

```{r pipe5}
pipeline_model <- ml_fit(pipeline, df)
pipeline_model
```

Note: As a result of the design of Spark ML, pipelines are always estimator objects, even if they comprise only transformers. This means that if you have a pipeline with only transformers, you still need to call ml_fit() on it to obtain a transformer. The “fitting” procedure in this case wouldn’t actually modify any of the transformers.

### Use Cases

Now that you have an understanding of the rudimentary concepts for ML Pipelines, let’s apply them to the predictive modeling problem from the previous chapter in which we are trying to predict whether people are currently employed by looking at their profiles. Our starting point is the okc_train DataFrame with the relevant columns.

```{r use1}
okc_train <- spark_read_parquet(sc, "data/okc-train.parquet")

okc_train <- okc_train %>% 
  select(not_working, age, sex, drinks, drugs, essay1:essay9, essay_length)
```

We first exhibit the pipeline, which includes feature engineering and modeling steps, and then walk through it:

```{r use2}
pipeline <- ml_pipeline(sc) %>%
  ft_string_indexer(input_col = "sex", output_col = "sex_indexed") %>%
  ft_string_indexer(input_col = "drinks", output_col = "drinks_indexed") %>%
  ft_string_indexer(input_col = "drugs", output_col = "drugs_indexed") %>%
  ft_one_hot_encoder_estimator(
    input_cols = c("sex_indexed", "drinks_indexed", "drugs_indexed"),
    output_cols = c("sex_encoded", "drinks_encoded", "drugs_encoded")
  ) %>%
  ft_vector_assembler(
    input_cols = c("age", "sex_encoded", "drinks_encoded", 
                   "drugs_encoded", "essay_length"), 
    output_col = "features"
  ) %>%
  ft_standard_scaler(input_col = "features", output_col = "features_scaled", 
                     with_mean = TRUE) %>%
  ml_logistic_regression(features_col = "features_scaled", 
                         label_col = "not_working")
```

**The first three stages index the sex, drinks, and drugs columns, which are characters, into numeric indices via ft_string_indexer(). This is necessary for the ft_one_hot_encoder_estimator() that comes next**, which requires numeric column inputs. When all of our predictor variables are of numeric type (recall that age is numeric already), **we can create our features vector using ft_vector_assembler(), which concatenates all of its inputs together into one column of vectors.** **We can then use ft_standard_scaler() to normalize all elements of the features column (including the one-hot-encoded 0/1 values of the categorical variables), and finally apply a logistic regression via ml_logistic_regression().**

During prototyping, you might want to execute these transformations eagerly on a small subset of the data, by passing the DataFrame to the ft_ and ml_ functions, and inspecting the transformed DataFrame. The immediate feedback allows for rapid iteration of ideas; when you have arrived at the desired processing steps, you can roll them up into a pipeline. For example, you can do the following:

```{r use3}
okc_train %>%
  ft_string_indexer("sex", "sex_indexed") %>% 
  select(sex_indexed)
```

After you have found the appropriate transformations for your dataset, you can replace the DataFrame input with ml_pipeline(sc), and the result will be a pipeline that you can apply to any DataFrame with the appropriate schema. 


### Hyperparameter Tuning

Going back to the pipeline we have created earlier, we can use ml_cross_validator() to perform the cross-validation workflow we demonstrated in the previous chapter and easily test different hyperparameter combinations. In this example, we test whether centering the variables improves predictions together with various regularization values for the logistic regression. We define the cross-validator as follows:

```{r hyper1}
cv <- ml_cross_validator(
  sc,
  estimator = pipeline,
  estimator_param_maps = list(
    standard_scaler = list(with_mean = c(TRUE, FALSE)),
    logistic_regression = list(
      elastic_net_param = c(0.25, 0.75),
      reg_param = c(1e-2, 1e-3)
    )
  ),
  evaluator = ml_binary_classification_evaluator(sc, label_col = "not_working"),
  num_folds = 10)
```
  
The estimator argument is simply the estimator that we want to tune, and in this case it is the pipeline that we defined. We provide the hyperparameter values we are interested in via the estimator_param_maps parameter, which takes a nested named list. The names at the first level correspond to UIDs, which are unique identifiers associated with each pipeline stage object, of the stages we want to tune (if a partial UID is provided, sparklyr will attempt to match it to a pipeline stage), and the names at the second level correspond to parameters of each stage. In the preceding snippet, we are specifying that we want to test the following:

```{r cv}
cv
```

As with any other estimator, we can fit the cross-validator by using ml_fit()

```{r cv_model}
cv_model <- ml_fit(cv, okc_train)
```


and then inspect the results:


```{r cv_model2}
ml_validation_metrics(cv_model) %>%
  arrange(-areaUnderROC)
```

Now that we have seen the pipelines API in action, let’s talk more formally about how they behave in various contexts.



## Operating Modes

By now, you have likely noticed that the pipeline stage functions, such as ft_string_indexer() and ml_logistic_regression(), return different types of objects depending on the first argument passed to them. Table 5.1 presents the full pattern.
TABLE 5.1: Operating modes in machine learning functions.
First.argument	Returns	Example
Spark connection	Estimator or transformer object	ft_string_indexer(sc)
Pipeline	Pipeline	ml_pipeline(sc) %>% ft_string_indexer()
Data frame, without formula	Data frame	ft_string_indexer(iris, “Species”, “indexed”)
Data frame, with formula	sparklyr ML model object	ml_logistic_regression(iris, Species ~ .)

**These functions are implemented using S3, which is the most popular object-oriented programming paradigm provided by R.** For our purposes, it suffices to know that the behavior of an ml_ or ft_ function is dictated by the class of the first argument provided. This allows us to provide a wide range of features without introducing additional function names. We now can summarize the behavior of these functions:

- If a Spark connection is provided, the function returns a transformer or estimator object, which can be utilized directly using ml_fit() or ml_transform() or be included in a pipeline.
- If a pipeline is provided, the function returns a pipeline object with the stage appended to it.
- If a DataFrame is provided to a feature transformer function (those with prefix ft_), or an ML algorithm without also providing a formula, the function instantiates the pipeline stage object, fits it to the data if necessary (if the stage is an estimator), and then transforms the DataFrame returning a DataFrame.
- If a DataFrame and a formula are provided to an ML algorithm that supports the formula interface, sparklyr builds a pipeline model under the hood and returns an ML model object that contains additional metadata information.

To take advantage of the full power of Spark ML and leverage pipelines for workflow organization and interoperability, it is worthwhile to learn the ML Pipelines API.


### Interoperability

**One of the most powerful aspects of pipelines is that they can be serialized to disk and are fully interoperable with the other Spark APIs such as Python and Scala.** This means that you can easily share them among users of Spark working in different languages, which might include other data scientists, data engineers, and deployment engineers. To save a pipeline model, call ml_save() and provide a path:

```{r inter1}
model_dir <- file.path("spark_model")
ml_save(cv_model$best_model, model_dir, overwrite = TRUE)
```

Let’s take a look at the directory to which we just wrote:

```{r inter2}
list.dirs(model_dir,full.names = FALSE) %>%
  head(10)
```

We can dive into a couple of the files to see what type of data was saved:

```{r inter3}
spark_read_json(sc, file.path(
  file.path(dir(file.path(model_dir, "stages"),
                pattern = "1_string_indexer.*",
                full.names = TRUE), "metadata")
)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

We see that quite a bit of information has been exported, from the SQL statement in the dplyr transformer to the fitted coefficient estimates of the logistic regression. We can then (in a new Spark session) reconstruct the model by using ml_load():

```{r inter4}
model_reload <- ml_load(sc, model_dir)
ml_stage(model_reload, "logistic_regression")
```

**Note that the exported JSON and parquet files are agnostic of the API that exported them. This means that in a multilingual machine learning engineering team, you can pick up a data preprocessing pipeline from a data engineer working in Python, build a prediction model on top of it, and then hand off the final pipeline to a deployment engineering working in Scala.** In the next section, we discuss deployment of models in more detail.

Note: When ml_save() is called for sparklyr ML models (created using the formula interface), the associated pipeline model is saved, but any sparklyr-specific metadata, such as index labels, is not. In other words, saving a sparklyr ml_model object and then loading it will yield a pipeline model object, as if you created it via the ML Pipelines API. This behavior is required to use pipelines with other programming languages.

Before we move on to discuss how to run pipelines in production, make sure you disconnect from Spark:

```{r inter4_}
spark_disconnect(sc)
``` 

## Deployment

In many cases, a data science project does not end with just a slide deck with insights and recommendations. Instead, the business problem at hand might require scoring new data points on a schedule or on-demand in real time. For example, a bank might want to evaluate its mortgage portfolio risk nightly or provide instant decisions on credit card applications. **This process of taking a model and turning it into a service that others can consume is usually referred to as deployment or productionization.** Historically, there was a large gap between the analyst who built the model and the engineer who deployed it: the former might work in R and develop extensive documentation on the scoring mechanism, so that the latter can reimplement the model in C++ or Java. This practice, which might easily take months in some organizations, is less prevalent today, but is almost always unnecessary in Spark ML workflows.

The aforementioned nightly portfolio risk and credit application scoring examples represent two modes of ML deployment known as batch and real time. Loosely, **batch processing implies processing many records at the same time, and that execution time is not important as long it is reasonable (often on the scale of minutes to hours).** On the other hand, **real-time processing implies scoring one or a few records at a time, but the latency is crucial (on the scale of <1 second).** 

#### Batch Scoring
**For both scoring methods, batch and real time, we will expose our model as web services, in the form of an API over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).** This is the primary medium over which software communicates. By providing an API, other services or end users can utilize our model without any knowledge of R or Spark. The plumber R package enables us to do this very easily by annotating our prediction function.

You will need make sure that plumber, callr, and the httr package are installed by running the following:

```{r batch1}
## install.packages(c("plumber", "callr", "httr"))
```

**The callr package provides support to run R code in separate R sessions**; it is not strictly required, but we will use it to start a web service in the background. The httr package allows us to use web APIs from R.

In the batch scoring use case, we simply initiate a Spark connection and load the saved model. Save the following script as plumber/spark-plumber.R:

```{r batch2}
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")

spark_model <- ml_load(sc, "spark_model")

#* @post /predict
score_spark <- function(age, sex, drinks, drugs, essay_length) {
  new_data <- data.frame(
    age = age,
    sex = sex,
    drinks = drinks,
    drugs = drugs,
    essay_length = essay_length,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
  new_data_tbl <- copy_to(sc, new_data, overwrite = TRUE)
  
  ml_transform(spark_model, new_data_tbl) %>%
    dplyr::pull(prediction)
}
``` 

We can then initialize the service by executing the following:

```{r batch3}
service <- callr::r_bg(function() {
  p <- plumber::plumb("plumber/spark-plumber.R")
  p$run(port = 8000)
})
```

This starts the web service locally, and then we can query the service with new data to be scored; however, you might need to wait a few seconds for the Spark service to initialize:

```{r batch4}
httr::content(httr::POST(
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict",
  body = '{"age": 42, "sex": "m", "drinks": "not at all", 
           "drugs": "never", "essay_length": 99}'
))
```

This reply tell us that this particular profile is likely to not be unemployed, that is, employed. We can now terminate the plumber service by stopping the callr service:

```{r batch5}
service$interrupt()
```

If we were to time this operation (e.g., with system.time()), we see that the latency is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which might be appropriate for batch applications but is insufficient for real time. The main bottleneck is the serialization of the R DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame and back. Also, it requires an active Spark session, which is a heavy runtime requirement. To ameliorate these issues, we discuss next a deployment method more suitable for real-time deployment.

#### Real-Time Scoring

For real-time production, we want to keep dependencies as light as possible so we can target more platforms for deployment. We now show how we can use the mleap package, which provides an interface to the MLeap library, to serialize and serve Spark ML models. MLeap is open source (Apache License 2.0) and supports a wide range of, though not all, Spark ML transformers. At runtime, the only prerequisites for the environment are the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the MLeap runtime library. This avoids both the Spark binaries and expensive overhead in converting data to and from Spark DataFrames.

Since mleap is a sparklyr extension and an R package, first we need to install it from CRAN:

```{r real1}
install.packages("mleap")
```

It then must be loaded when spark_connect() is called; so let’s restart your R session, establish a new Spark connection,20 and load the pipeline model that we previously saved:

```{r real2}
library(sparklyr)
library(mleap)
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")
spark_model <- ml_load(sc, "spark_model")
```

The way we save a model to MLeap bundle format is very similar to saving a model using the Spark ML Pipelines API; the only additional argument is sample_input, which is a Spark DataFrame with schema that we expect new data to be scored to have:

```{r real3}
sample_input <- data.frame(
  sex = "m",
  drinks = "not at all",
  drugs = "never",
  essay_length = 99,
  age = 25,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

sample_input_tbl <- copy_to(sc, sample_input)

ml_write_bundle(spark_model, sample_input_tbl, "mleap_model.zip", overwrite = TRUE)
```

We can now deploy the artifact we just created, mleap_model.zip, in any device that runs Java and has the open source MLeap runtime dependencies, without needing Spark or R! In fact, we can go ahead and disconnect from Spark already:

```{r real4}
spark_disconnect(sc)
```

Before we use this MLeap model, make sure the runtime dependencies are installed:

```{r real5}
mleap::install_maven()
mleap::install_mleap()
```

To test this model, we can create a new plumber API to expose it. The script plumber/mleap-plumber.R is very similar to the previous example:

```{r real6}
library(mleap)

mleap_model <- mleap_load_bundle("mleap_model.zip")

#* @post /predict
score_spark <- function(age, sex, drinks, drugs, essay_length) {
  new_data <- data.frame(
    age = as.double(age),
    sex = sex,
    drinks = drinks,
    drugs = drugs,
    essay_length = as.double(essay_length),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
  mleap_transform(mleap_model, new_data)$prediction
}
```

And the way we launch the service is exactly the same:

```{r real7}
service <- callr::r_bg(function() {
  p <- plumber::plumb("plumber/mleap-plumber.R")
  p$run(port = 8000)
})
```

We can run the exact same code we did previously to test unemployment predictions in this new service:

```{r real8}
httr::POST(
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict",
  body = '{"age": 42, "sex": "m", "drinks": "not at all", 
           "drugs": "never", "essay_length": 99}'
) %>%
  httr::content()
```

If we were to time this operation, we would see that the service now returns predictions in tens of milliseconds.
Let’s stop this service and then wrap up this chapter:

```{r real9}
service$interrupt()
```

# Clusters

There are three major trends in cluster computing worth discussing: on-premises, cloud computing, and Kubernetes. Framing these trends over time will help us understand how they came to be, what they are, and what their future might be.

For on-premises clusters, you or someone in your organization purchased physical computers that were intended to be used for cluster computing. The computers in this cluster are made of off-the-shelf hardware, meaning that someone placed an order to purchase computers usually found on store shelves, or high-performance hardware, meaning that a computing vendor provided highly customized computing hardware, which also comes optimized for high-performance network connectivity, power consumption, and so on.

When purchasing hundreds or thousands of computing instances, it doesn’t make sense to keep them in the usual computing case that we are all familiar with; instead, it makes sense to stack them as efficiently as possible on top of one another to minimize the space the use. This group of efficiently stacked computing instances is known as a rack.

Amazon started as an online bookstore, but over the years it grew to sell much more than just books. Along with its online store growth, its datacenters also grew in size. In 2002, Amazon considered renting servers in their datacenters to the public, and two years later, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched as a way to let anyone rent servers in the company’s datacenters on demand, meaning that you did not need to purchase, configure, maintain, or tear down your own clusters; rather, you could rent them directly from AWS.

This on-demand compute model is what we know today as cloud computing. In the cloud, the cluster you use is not owned by you, and it’s not in your physical building; instead it’s a datacenter owned and managed by someone else.

While the benefits of processing data in the cloud were obvious for many years, picking a cloud provider had the unintended side effect of locking in organizations with one particular provider, making it hard to switch between providers or back to on-premises clusters. Kubernetes, announced by Google in 2014, is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts. In practice, it makes it easier to deploy across multiple cloud providers and on-premises as well.

In summary, we have seen a transition from on-premises to cloud computing and, more recently, Kubernetes. These technologies are often loosely described as the private cloud, the public cloud, and as one of the orchestration services that can enable a hybrid cloud, respectively.

## On-premise

These clusters can be highly customized and controlled; however, they can also incur higher initial expenses and maintenance costs.

When using on-premises Spark clusters, there are two concepts you should consider:

Cluster manager
In a similar way as to how an operating system (like Windows or macOS) allows you to run multiple applications in the same computer, a cluster manager allows multiple applications to be run in the same cluster. You need to choose one yourself when working with on-premises clusters.
Spark distribution
While you can install Spark from the Apache Spark site, many organizations partner with companies that can provide support and enhancements to Apache Spark, which we often refer to as Spark distributions.

In Spark Standalone, Spark uses itself as its own cluster manager, which allows you to use Spark without installing additional software in your cluster. This can be useful if you are planning to use your cluster to run only Spark applications; if this cluster is not dedicated to Spark, a generic cluster manager like YARN, Mesos, or Kubernetes would be more suitable. 

## Cloud

In cloud services, the compute instances are billed for as long the Spark cluster runs; your billing starts when the cluster launches, and it stops when the cluster stops. This cost needs to be multiplied by the number of instances reserved for your cluster. So, for instance, if a cloud provider charges $1.00 per compute instance per hour, and you start a three-node cluster that you use for one hour and 10 minutes, it is likely that you’ll receive a bill for $1.00 x 2 hours x 3 nodes = $6.00. 

Be aware that, while computing costs can be quite low for small clusters, accidentally leaving a cluster running can cause significant billing expenses. Therefore, it’s worth taking the extra time to check twice that your cluster is terminated when you no longer need it. It’s also a good practice to monitor costs daily while using clusters to make sure your expectations match the daily bill.

### Amazon

Amazon provides cloud services through AWS; more specifically, it provides an on-demand Spark cluster through Amazon EMR.

[Running sparklyr in AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/big-data/running-sparklyr-rstudios-r-interface-to-spark-on-amazon-emr/) This post introduced the launch of sparklyr and instructions to configure Amazon EMR clusters with sparklyr. For instance, it suggests you can use the Amazon Command Line Interface to launch a cluster with three nodes.

### Google

Google provides Google Cloud Dataproc as a cloud-based managed Spark and Hadoop service offered on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Dataproc utilizes many GCP technologies, such as Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Storage, to offer fully managed clusters running popular data processing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.



## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications that was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes was originally based on Docker, while, like Mesos, it’s also based on Linux Cgroups.

Kubernetes can execute many cluster applications and frameworks that you can highly customize by using container images with specific resources and libraries. This allows a single Kubernetes cluster to be used for many different purposes beyond data analysis, which in turn helps organizations manage their compute resources with ease.


# Connections

The overall connection architecture for a Spark cluster is composed of three types of compute instances: the driver node, the worker nodes, and the cluster manager.

The worker nodes (also referred to as executors) execute compute tasks over partitioned data and communicate intermediate results to other workers or back to the driver node. The driver node is tasked with delegating work to the worker nodes, but also with aggregating their results and controlling computation flow.
